Q: What is array?
Array has only similar type of item

Array stored in contiguous memory location

Q. Why?
*** By helping of arrays can stored multiple values in a single variable

Q. Find location
Array size = n
So, index = n - 1 = location of n

If the value is 0 or a value that fits into a single byte, you can use the memset function from <string.h>. memset(arr, 0, sizeof(arr)); // Set all bytes to 0 (good for initializing to 0)
